## Retinotopy Utilities

This directory contains utility scripts for solving the pRF models from a retinotopy experiment
using VistaSoft. The intended usage is to copy all three of these scripts to your VistaSoft
session's `Code` directory (e.g., `Projects/Retinotopy/wl_subj042/20170810_ColorRetinotopy/Code`)
then to invoke them from there. The script may need to be edited if being used outside the
Winawer lab or if you want to analyze subsets of your retinotopy data instead of just an average
of all retinotopy scans.

For a clearer example of how to use these scripts, see
[this demo page](https://noahbenson.github.io/Retinotopy-Tutorial/).
